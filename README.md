# Data cleaning is an essential step in any data analysis project. In this repository, I share my approach to cleaning data using R.

One of the challenges in data cleaning is dealing with missing data. To address this, I use the "mice" package to impute random missing data. This method is ideal when all variables in your data are important contributors to the overall analysis.

With "mice", multiple estimates of each missing value are generated based on the trends in your data. This is done through multiple iterations, resulting in "m" imputed values.

By using this approach, you can standardize your data and ensure that it's ready for analysis. Check out the code in this repository to see how it works and feel free to use it in your own data cleaning projects.
